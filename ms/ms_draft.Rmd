Main Ideas

===

* Host competence within species (and within genotype) can be moderated by environmental conditions such as ambient temperature and resource availability

* Effects of temperature on disease dynamics are well-studied
 + Altizer et al. 2013 - effects of climate change on disease
 + temperature can affect population growth rates
 
* Effects of resource availability on disease also well-studied
 + increased carrying capacity
 + increasing host density from resource aggregation
 
* Effects of temperature and resource conditions can influence each other and interact in interesting ways

* Daphnia-Metschnikowia useful model system for studying interactions between temperature and resources
 + Host (daphnia) highly sensitive to ambient temperature
    - Daphnia foraging rates increase with temperature - foraging rate analogous to transmission rate
    - host growth rate sensitive to temperature
