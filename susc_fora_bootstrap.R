#estimate per-spore susceptibility using infection and foraging rate data
#beta can be estimaed using infection data from a life table infection assay
#foraging rate is measured separately
#beta is per-spore susceptibility * foraging rate
#so if we can estimate beta, then we can tease out per-spore susceptibility because we have foraging rate as well
