## Data

All data can be found in the /raw_data directory.

"treatments.csv" includes the treatment ID used and details about the birth date, exposure date, and treatment conditions.

"mortality.csv" includes data taken when hosts died. This includes date of death, length, infections status, and spore yield.

"fitness.csv" includes data on neonate production. Each observation is the number of neonates produced since the prior observation. Neonates were always removed after counting. 

## Scripts

All scripts that generate figures can be found in the /scripts directory.

"exploration.Rmd" in /workshop has some quick summary stats and visualizations of the data. Work in progress.
